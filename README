-----------------
Set up your basic Yocto Project build environment following the
instructions in meta-fsl-bsp-release/imx/README. DO NOT START BITBAKE.

Set up the i.MX GPU SDK layer in your build environment by executing
the setup script. Assuming you're in the build directory:

    $ ../sources/meta-imx-gpu-sdk/setup.sh

Build one of the standard i.MX images. For example:

    $ bitbake fsl-image-gui

The applications will be installed in your rootfs at /opt.
